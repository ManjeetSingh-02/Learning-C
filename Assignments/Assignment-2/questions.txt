  Operator    Meaning of Operator

     +        addition or unary plus

     -        subtraction or unary minus

     *        multiplication

     /        division

     %        remainder after division
(modulo division)





  Output:- if a=9 and b = 4 then

    a+b = 13

    a-b = 5

    a*b = 36

    a/b = 2

    Remainder when a divided by b=1





8.  Write a C program A relational operator checks the relationship
between two operands. 

If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it
returns value 0.

Operator    Meaning of Operator    Example

==    Equal to              
   5 == 3 is evaluated to 0

>    Greater than              
   5 > 3 is evaluated to 1

<    Less than              
   5 < 3 is evaluated to 0

!=    Not equal to              
   5 != 3 is evaluated to 1

>=    Greater than or equal to      5 >= 3 is
evaluated to 1

<=    Less than or equal to           5
<= 3 is evaluated to 0





9. An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending
upon whether expression results true or false. Logical operators are commonly
used in decision making in C programming.



  Operator    

  &&

  ||

  !

11. Write a C program to enter a five digit number and find sum and difference
of all digit.



12. Write a C program to enter a five digit number and find sum and difference
of 1st , 3rd , 5th digit number.
